Execute only the delegated implementation/TDD phase using the durable handoff and repository authority. You may use the bound explorer when useful. Do not invoke Matt `/implement`, `/implement-spec` or `/code-review`, and do not launch reviewers/correctors.

Keep the implementation loop focused: batch related reads when practical, make coherent mutations, run focused TDD and the smallest relevant deterministic checks. Broad/full suites are not a writer default unless the handoff/repository explicitly requires them at this candidate boundary.

Do not reopen accepted product/architecture decisions. If implementation exposes an unresolved material product/architecture/scope/privacy/data-semantics/acceptance choice, STOP and return the concrete question to the coordinator for Cora + human.

Apply only conditional safeguards explicitly named in the handoff. Do not start a repository-wide sibling/consumer audit. If ordinary implementation work incidentally reveals a material affected surface outside the envelope, report it and STOP rather than widening scope.

Commit/return the fixed candidate when requested with the focused evidence required by the handoff. Your write phase ends when you return the candidate or review starts. Never apply review-driven edits yourself. Do not push or merge.
